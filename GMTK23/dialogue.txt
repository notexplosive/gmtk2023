Look buddy, we got an image to uphold.

You need to keep a balance with the player...

... not too hard that they get anxious

... and not to easy that they get bored

You wanna find that sweet spot, right in the middle.

Once we hit that sweet spot, I'll call in the big guns. The BOSS.

The bosses in this game are famously hard, so once the boss is out, you can go nuts.
